Roblox Bot is an API that allows you to act under a Roblox user.
This bot is asynchronus, which means actions called such as Login, are done seperately from the thread you are calling from.

When using this bot you must be following the [Terms of Service](https://www.roblox.com/Info/terms-of-service) and [Rules of Conduct](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/203313410), bots are not exempt from these rules.
I am not responsible for the way you use this bot api, although I **do not** want you to use this for a malicious intent.
